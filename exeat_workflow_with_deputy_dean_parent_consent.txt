EXEAT WORKFLOW SYSTEM - COMPLETE FLOW WITH DEPUTY DEAN PARENT CONSENT FEATURE
================================================================================

This document describes the complete exeat workflow from beginning to end, including the new feature where the Deputy Dean can act as a parent for parent consent after the deputy-dean_review stage.

1. INITIAL EXEAT REQUEST CREATION
==================================

STEP 1: Student Creates Exeat Request
- Student logs into the system using their credentials
- Student navigates to exeat request creation form
- Student fills out required information:
  * Reason for exeat
  * Start date and time
  * End date and time
  * Destination
  * Contact information
  * Emergency contact details
  * Category (medical, personal, academic, etc.)
- System determines if request is medical-related based on category
- System creates ExeatRequest record with initial status:
  * Medical requests: status = 'cmd_review'
  * Non-medical requests: status = 'deputy-dean_review'
- System creates first ExeatApproval record:
  * Medical: role = 'medical_officer', status = 'pending'
  * Non-medical: role = 'deputy_dean', status = 'pending'
- System sends confirmation email to student
- Audit log created: action = 'create', details = 'Exeat request created'

2. APPROVAL WORKFLOW STAGES
===========================

STAGE 1: CMD Review (Medical Requests Only)
--------------------------------------------
IF request is medical:
- Status: 'cmd_review'
- CMD (Chief Medical Officer) reviews the request
- CMD can:
  a) APPROVE: 
     - ExeatApproval.status = 'approved'
     - ExeatRequest.status advances to 'deputy-dean_review'
     - Audit log: action = 'approve', staff_id = CMD's ID
  b) REJECT:
     - ExeatApproval.status = 'rejected'
     - ExeatRequest.status = 'rejected'
     - Workflow ends
     - Audit log: action = 'reject', staff_id = CMD's ID

STAGE 2: Deputy Dean Review
---------------------------
- Status: 'deputy-dean_review'
- Deputy Dean reviews the request
- Deputy Dean can:
  a) APPROVE:
     - ExeatApproval.status = 'approved'
     - ExeatRequest.status advances to 'parent_consent'
     - System automatically triggers parent consent process
     - Audit log: action = 'approve', staff_id = Deputy Dean's ID
  b) REJECT:
     - ExeatApproval.status = 'rejected'
     - ExeatRequest.status = 'rejected'
     - Workflow ends
     - Audit log: action = 'reject', staff_id = Deputy Dean's ID

STAGE 3: Parent Consent (NEW FEATURE ENHANCED)
-----------------------------------------------
- Status: 'parent_consent'
- System creates ParentConsent record with unique token
- System sends consent request to parent via:
  * Email with approval/rejection links
  * SMS with approval/rejection links
  * WhatsApp message with approval/rejection links
- Parent can:
  a) APPROVE via web link or API:
     - ParentConsent.consent_status = 'approved'
     - ExeatRequest.status advances to 'dean_review'
     - Audit log: action = 'parent_consent_approve', staff_id = null
  b) REJECT via web link or API:
     - ParentConsent.consent_status = 'declined'
     - ExeatRequest.status = 'rejected'
     - Workflow ends
     - Audit log: action = 'parent_consent_decline', staff_id = null

**NEW FEATURE: Deputy Dean Acting as Parent**

If parent doesn't respond within reasonable time, Deputy Dean can act on behalf of parent:

Deputy Dean Parent Consent Actions:
- Deputy Dean can access parent consent interface
- Deputy Dean can perform same actions as parent:
  a) APPROVE on behalf of parent:
     - ParentConsent.consent_status = 'approved'
     - ParentConsent.acted_by_staff_id = Deputy Dean's ID (new field)
     - ExeatRequest.status advances to 'dean_review'
     - Audit log: action = 'deputy_dean_parent_consent_approve', 
       staff_id = Deputy Dean's ID, 
       details = 'Deputy Dean approved on behalf of parent'
  b) REJECT on behalf of parent:
     - ParentConsent.consent_status = 'declined'
     - ParentConsent.acted_by_staff_id = Deputy Dean's ID (new field)
     - ExeatRequest.status = 'rejected'
     - Workflow ends
     - Audit log: action = 'deputy_dean_parent_consent_reject', 
       staff_id = Deputy Dean's ID, 
       details = 'Deputy Dean rejected on behalf of parent'

Implementation Requirements for New Feature:
1. Add 'acted_by_staff_id' field to ParentConsent model
2. Add new endpoints in StaffExeatRequestController:
   - POST /api/staff/exeat-requests/{id}/parent-consent/approve

3. Add permission checks to ensure only Deputy Dean can act as parent

  b) REJECT:
     - ExeatApproval.status = 'rejected'

5. Action is clearly recorded in audit trail with Deputy Dean's staff ID
6. ParentConsent record tracks who performed the action (parent or deputy dean)
7. Workflow continues normally to dean_review stage
8. All existing parent consent functionality remains unchanged
9. Clear audit trail distinguishes between parent and deputy dean actions
10. Permission system ensures only Deputy Dean can act as parent

This feature provides a fallback mechanism when parents are unresponsive while maintaining full accountability through comprehensive audit logging.
