# API Test Script Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the comprehensive PHP test script (`api_test_script.php`) that simulates and tests all exeat and notification APIs in the Laravel backend system.

## Features
- **Complete API Coverage**: Tests all 111 API endpoints from the API documentation
- **Mock Data Simulation**: Uses realistic mock data instead of actual database operations
- **Role-Based Testing**: Tests APIs for different user roles (Student, Staff, Dean, Admin, CMD, Hostel, Security)
- **Authentication Flow**: Simulates complete login/logout cycles
- **File-Based Output**: Writes all test results and mock data to `.txt` files
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates detailed test summaries with success rates

- Role-specific announcements

## Output Files

### 1. test_results.txt
Contains detailed logs of all API calls including:
- Request data
- Response data
- Success/failure status
- Comprehensive test summary

### 2. mock_data.txt
Contains all mock data operations including:
- User authentication records
- Exeat request creations
- Notification deliveries
- System operations

### 3. test_error.log
Contains any errors encountered during testing

## How to Run

```bash
php api_test_script.php
```

## Data Safety
- **No Database Operations**: All data is written to text files
- **Mock Data Only**: No real user data is used
- **Safe Testing**: No actual emails or SMS are sent
- **Isolated Environment**: Tests run independently

## Benefits
1. **Complete API Validation**: Ensures all endpoints work as expected
2. **Workflow Testing**: Validates entire exeat approval process
3. **Role Verification**: Confirms proper access control
4. **Integration Testing**: Tests API interactions
5. **Documentation**: Provides clear API usage examples
6. **Debugging Aid**: Helps identify potential issues

## Notes
- All tests use mock data and simulate database operations
- No actual database modifications are made
- Email and SMS operations are simulated
- Parent consent uses mock tokens
- All file operations are safe and isolated

This test script provides comprehensive coverage of the exeat and notification system APIs, ensuring reliability and proper functionality across all user roles and workflows.
