# Student Exeat Debt System Documentation

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive guide to the student exeat debt system, including the debt creation process, payment flow using Paystack, exeat management, and API usage instructions.

## Complete System Flow

### 1. Debt Creation Process
- The system runs a scheduled command (`exeat:check-overdue`) to identify overdue exeat requests
- For each overdue exeat, the system calculates debt based on the number of days overdue
- A new debt record is created in the `student_exeat_debts` table or existing records are updated
- Students are notified about their debt

### 2. Fee Structure
- 10,000 Naira per day (24 hours) of overdue exeat
- Partial days are counted as full days (e.g., 25 hours overdue = 2 days = 20,000 Naira)

### 3. Payment Process
- Student views their debts through the student portal
- Student initiates payment via Paystack
- System generates a payment reference and authorization URL
- Student is redirected to Paystack payment page
- After payment, student is redirected back to the application
- System verifies the payment with Paystack
- Upon successful verification, debt is automatically marked as cleared
- Student receives a notification about debt clearance

### 4. Exeat Management
- Admins and deans can view all exeat requests in the system
- Admins and deans can edit exeat details including:
  - Purpose of exeat
  - Departure date and time
  - Expected return date and time
  - Actual return date and time
  - Status (pending, approved, rejected, completed, overdue)
- When an exeat is edited, the system recalculates any associated debt
- All edits are logged in the audit trail

### 5. Debt Management
- Admins and deans can view all student debts in the system
- They can filter debts by payment status (unpaid, cleared)
- They can filter debts by student
- They can view detailed payment information including:
  - Payment date
  - Payment reference
  - Payment method
  - Transaction details from Paystack
- They can view the audit trail for each debt

### 6. Audit Trail
- All actions related to debt creation, payment, clearance, and exeat edits are logged in the `audit_logs` table
- Each log entry includes details about the action, the user who performed it, and relevant data

## Database Structure

## Implementation Details

### PaystackService

- `initializeTransaction`: Prepares and sends payment initialization requests
- `verifyTransaction`: Checks the status of a transaction using its reference

### StudentExeatDebtController
The controller manages student debt operations:

- `index`: Lists all debts for the authenticated student
- `show`: Shows details of a specific debt
- `updatePaymentProof`: Initializes Paystack payment
- `verifyPayment`: Verifies payment status and updates debt record

### AdminExeatController
The controller manages exeat operations for administrators:

- `index`: Lists all exeat requests
- `show`: Shows details of a specific exeat request
- `update`: Updates an exeat request's details and recalculates debt if needed

### DeanExeatController
The controller manages exeat operations for deans:

- `index`: Lists all exeat requests
- `show`: Shows details of a specific exeat request
- `update`: Updates an exeat request's details and recalculates debt if needed

### AdminStudentDebtController

  "actual_return_date": "2023-10-18T09:00:00",
  "status": "completed"
}
```

**Response:** Same format as admin and dean endpoints

### Overdue Exeat Detection

#### CheckOverdueExeats Command
The command checks for overdue exeats and calculates debt:

- Runs on a schedule (typically daily)
- Identifies exeats that are past their return date
- Calculates debt based on days overdue (10,000 Naira per day)
- Creates or updates debt records
- Sends notifications to students

#### Debt Calculation Logic

- The system calculates overdue hours by comparing the return date with the actual return date
- If actual_return_date is not set, the current date and time is used
- Overdue hours are converted to days (rounded up)
- Each day is charged at 10,000 Naira
- Partial days are counted as full days (e.g., 25 hours = 2 days = 20,000 Naira)

## Important Notes

1. All successful payments are automatically marked as cleared without requiring admin or dean approval
2. The system uses Paystack's reference for tracking payments
3. All payment activities are logged in the audit trail
4. Students receive notifications when their debts are cleared
5. The fee structure is based solely on daily charges (10,000 Naira per day)
